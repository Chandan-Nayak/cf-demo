------------------
    >> Why this
        - reliable and repeatable stack deployment
        - easy to learn - JSON format
        - infrastructure as code and versioned
        - can perform CRUD operations on resources created by CF
        - free

    >> Basic Structure of CF template [DEMO]

    >> Creating a VPC with public subnet [DEMO]

    >> Interacting with CF using - terminal and CF console [DEMO]

    >> Get one instance up and get solr running on it [DEMO]

        > understanding what is needed to get solr up and running
            - get java
            - solr.gz
            - tomcat.gz
            - extract solr webapp and place inside tomcat webapp
            - create folders and place configuration files in palce
            - start tomcat

        > cfn.init

    >> How this works behind the scene

    >> Usage of this in mercatus [FIGURE]

    >> What is not so good in CF
        - works only with aws
        - debugging
        - application deployment
        - software installation and maintenance
